# angular-markdown-directive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/btford/angular-markdown-directive.png)](https://travis-ci.org/btford/angular-markdown-directive)

Bower Component for a simple AngularJS Markdown directive using [Showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown). Based on [this excellent tutorial](http://blog.angularjs.org/2012/05/custom-components-part-1.html) by [@johnlinquist](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist).


## Usage
1. `bower install angular-markdown-directive`
2. Include `angular-sanitize.js`. It should be located at `bower_components/angular-sanitize/`.
3. Include `showdown.js`. It should be located at `bower_components/showdown/`.
4. Include `markdown.js` provided by this component into your app.
5. Add `btford.markdown` as a module dependency to your app.
6. Insert the `btf-markdown` directive into your template:

```html
<btf-markdown>#Markdown directive *It works!*</btf-markdown>
```

You can also bind the markdown input to a scope variable:

```html
<div btf-markdown="markdown">
</div>
<!-- Uses $scope.markdown -->
```

Or include a markdown file:

```html
<div btf-markdown ng-include="'README.md'">
</div>
<!-- Uses content from README.md -->
```


## Options

You can configure the `markdownConverterProvider`:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [
  'ngSanitize',
  'btford.markdown'
]).
config(['markdownConverterProvider', function (markdownConverterProvider) {
  // options to be passed to Showdown
  // see: https://github.com/coreyti/showdown#extensions
  markdownConverterProvider.config({
    extensions: ['twitter']
  });
}])
```

Note: Since default showdown extensions are no more provided with showdown, you will have to install them from your dependencies manager. The twitter extension used in the sample above is available from `https://github.com/showdownjs/twitter-extension`.
